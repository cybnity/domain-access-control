## PURPOSE
The space presents the implementation view of the developed Access Control systems acting into the application layer.
The presented implementation view of this section are mainly focused on transversal information involding several implementation components (see sub-packages dedicated documentations for more detail per component and/or module).

# COMPONENTS INTEGRATION
Presentation of the coupling models implemented as static or dynamic links between applicative modules (e.g process module, feature module) over interactions spaces (e.g Users Interactions Space; or Domains Interactions Space).

## INVOLVED

## STREAMS & CHANNELS OVERVIEW
Several Redis Streams or Redis Topics are defining a routing plan between the domain features in a dynamic way. The Recipient List pattern is implemented that allow real-time instantiation and change or the transport relative to the events exchanged by the components into the application layer.
