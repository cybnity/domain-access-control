 * Package of elements required to implement the Privileged Access Management

 * just-in-time access to a critical resource, remote access using encrypted
 * gateway in place of password).
 * 
 * For example, this type of identities and access management allow to monitor
 * sessions regarding validation audit, to analyze suspects activities, to
 * capture events associated to privileged accounts for audit the conformity.
